   value data type        ASCII_Date_Time_YMD_UTC
   description            reference_time_utc provides a date and time in UTC format. Given in a label when time values in a table are given as elapsed seconds offset from a reference time. Unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, reference_time_utc should correspond to the start of a day. Required anytime a table field is given relative to a specific date and time other than when Barycentric Dynamical Time is used (e.g., observed_event_tdb). 
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   observed_event_time
   version                1.0
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_event_time indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. As a field in an occultation profile table, it is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. The reference time is preferably the start of a day. In a label the corresponding time interval end point values are given by the required start_date_time_utc and stop_date_time_utc attributes in the Time_Coordinates class. At least one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time. Note: For occultation data, PDS prefers year-month-day format for dates rather than year plus day-of-year format. However, either format is permitted. 
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   maximum_observed_event_time
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            maximum_observed_event_time gives the largest value for observed_event_time in the associated data file. It is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. maximum_observed_event_time is optional in labels since the data file time interval end point values are given by the required start_date_time_utc and stop_date_time_utc attributes in the Time_Coordinates class. 
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   minimum_observed_event_time
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            minimum_observed_event_time gives the smallest value for observed_event_time in the associated data file. It is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. minimum_observed_event_time is optional in labels since the data file time interval end point values are given by the required start_date_time_utc and stop_date_time_utc attributes in the Time_Coordinates class. 
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   observed_event_tdb
   version                1.0
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_event_tdb indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. It is represented in the 'Barycentric Dynamical Time' system, as a number of elapsed seconds since the J2000 epoch. This is consistent with the definition of 'ephemeris time' as used in the SPICE toolkit. In a label the corresponding values are given by the optional start_observed_event_tdb and stop_observed_event_tdb attributes. At least one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time.

   description            observed_event_start_tdb indicates the value for earliest time in the described data, and is given in elapsed seconds since the J2000 epoch. Optional in labels; not intended for use as a table field.
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   observed_event_stop_tdb
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_event_stop_tdb indicates the value for latest time in the described data, and is given in elapsed seconds since the J2000 epoch. Optional in labels; not intended for use as a table field. 
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Time

   name                   observed_event_time_utc
   version                1.0
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            This attribute is intended to be used as a column in a table. observed_event_time_utc indicates the UTC time corresponding to the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. In a label the corresponding values may be given by the optional start_observed_event_utc and stop_observed_event_utc attributes (or the corresponding values using Barycentric Dynamical Time, _tdb). At least one of either observed_event_time_utc or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time.

   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_ring_elevation is an angle measured at a point in the ring plane, starting from the ring plane to the direction of a photon heading to the observer. This angle is positive on the side of the ring plane defined by positive angular momentum, and negative on the opposite side. Values range from -90 to +90 in units of degrees. This angle is constant for stellar occultations, but may vary significantly during radio occultations. Note: The direction of positive angular momentum points toward the IAU-defined north side of the ring plane for Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, but IAU-defined south side of the ring plane for Uranus. Required in the label if the value is constant for the observation. If the angle varies for the observation, the min and max attributes are required in the label, and observed_ring_elevation is strongly recommended as a field in the data table.

   description            light_source_incidence_angle is an angle measured from the local surface normal vector to the direction of a photon arriving from the light source. For rings, the normal vector is that on the same side of the rings as the light source, so values always range between 0 and 90 in units of degrees. The value is always equal to 90 - | observed_ring_elevation | This will enable users to perform database searches based on the effective ring opening angle when they are not concerned about the distinction between north-side and southside viewpoints. We have included the 'light source' prefix to the term so that this quantity is not confused with 'incidence angle', a term that is generally associated with sunlight rather than stars or radio transmitters. Required in the label if the value is constant for the observation. If the angle varies for the observation, the min and max attributes are required in the label.

   name                   Display_Direction
   description            The Display_Direction class specifies which two of the dimensions of an Array object should be displayed and how they should be displayed in the vertical (line) and horizontal (sample) dimensions of a display device. This class is a modification of the corresponding class in the Display Dictionary, and is redefined here for convenience. The local_identifier_reference is used to identify the array or arrays to which this iteration of the class applies. Multiple entries are permitted the settings in the iteration of Display_Direction apply to all of the referenced arrays.

   name                   Uniformly_Sampled_Radius
   description             The Uniformly_Sampled_Radius class provides attributes describing the spectral characteristics of an axis of an Array object or the rows of a Table object, in cases where the spectral sampling interval is regular and the sampling parameters are in wavelength units. The axis is identified either by using Local_Internal_Reference, or by using axis name. The latter may be simpler to use if this class applies to multiple Array objects.
