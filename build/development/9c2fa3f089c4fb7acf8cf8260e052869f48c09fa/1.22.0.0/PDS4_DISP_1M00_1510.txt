   Comment                This dictionary describes how to display Array data on a display device.
  
    ## CHANGE LOG ##

    1.5.0.0
    - ported from 1.4.0.0 schema to LDD for PDS IM 1E00 and 1F00
    - added two rules under Display_Settings_0, (1) to add at least one 
      local_reference_type, for now - 'display_settings_to_array' and 
      (2) to make sure local_identifier_reference values under Display matches 
      the local_identifier attribute under Array_*
      - This rule also seems to be inserted during LDDtool build 
        so currently it is being duplicated.
      
    1.5.1.0 
    - Added display_settings_validate_axis rules and tests for the new rules by Jesse S.
