   name                   reference_time_utc
   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Date_Time_YMD_UTC
   description            reference_time_utc provides a date and time in UTC format. Given in a label when time values in a table are given as elapsed seconds offset from a reference time. Unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, reference_time_utc should correspond to the start of a day. Required anytime a table field is given relative to a specific date and time other than when Barycentric Dynamical Time is used (e.g., observed_event_tdb). 

   name                   observed_event_time
   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_event_time indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. As a field in an occultation profile table, it is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. The reference time is preferably the start of a day. In a label the corresponding time interval end point values are given by the required start_date_time_utc and stop_date_time_utc attributes in the Time_Coordinates class. At least one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time. Note: For occultation data, PDS prefers year-month-day format for dates rather than year plus day-of-year format. However, either format is permitted.

   description            maximum_observed_event_time gives the largest value for observed_event_time in the associated data file. It is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. maximum_observed_event_time is optional in labels since the data file time interval end point values are given by the required start_date_time_utc and stop_date_time_utc attributes in the Time_Coordinates class.

   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_event_tdb indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. It is represented in the 'Barycentric Dynamical Time' system, as a number of elapsed seconds since the J2000 epoch. This is consistent with the definition of 'ephemeris time' as used in the SPICE toolkit. In a label the corresponding values are given by the optional start_observed_event_tdb and stop_observed_event_tdb attributes. At least one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station.

   description            This attribute is intended to be used as a column in a table. observed_event_time_utc indicates the UTC time corresponding to the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. In a label the corresponding values may be given by the optional start_observed_event_utc and stop_observed_event_utc attributes (or the corresponding values using Barycentric Dynamical Time, _tdb). At least one of either observed_event_time_utc or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data.

Required table field for radio occultation data, but not used in stellar occultation data. The time is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. The reference time is preferably the start of a day, and is required to be given in the label using the attribute reference_time_utc.

Intended to be used as a table field which is optional for stellar occultations, and is not used for radio occultation data (one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb is used instead). earth_received_time is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. The reference time is preferably the start of a day, and is required to be given in the label using the attribute reference_time_utc. This is equivalent to OBSERVED_EVENT_TIME for radio occultations. It is an optional table field for stellar occultations and is not used for radio occultations. When earth_received_time is used, the attribute reference_time_utc is required in the label.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            occultation_type distinguishes between three types of occultation experiments: Stellar, Solar, or Radio. Stellar occultations involve observing a star as a targeted ring or body passes in front, as seen from either a spacecraft or Earth-based observatory. Solar occultations are similar to stellar occultations except that the Sun is used in place of a star. Radio occultations typically involve observing the continuous-wave radio transmissions from a spacecraft as it passes behind the target as seen from a radio telescope on Earth or another spacecraft. Required in labels of occultation observations. Normally not intended as a value for a table field.

   name                   occultation_direction
   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            occultation_direction indicates the direction of an occultation track. This refers to the observed occultation track overall, not to the subset that might appear in a particular file (e.g., if an occultation includes both ingress and egress tracks, the value for occultation_direction will be both in the data products for each occultation profile. Permitted values are 'ingress', 'egress', 'both', and 'multiple'. The value 'multiple' is used where the occultation track is not monotonic over relatively short time scales. Generally only used for some Hubble-based occultations. May be appropriate for extremely long duration occultations of a high proper motion star (e.g., u36).

   description            observed_ring_elevation is an angle measured at a point in the ring plane, starting from the ring plane to the direction of a photon heading to the observer.

The emission_angle varies from 0 degrees when the spacecraft is viewing the subspacecraft point (nadir viewing) to 90 degrees when the intercept is tangent to the surface of the target body. Thus, higher values of emission_angle indicate more oblique viewing of the target.

   version                1.22
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            light_source_incidence_angle is an angle measured from the local surface normal vector to the direction of a photon arriving from the light source. For rings, the normal vector is that on the same side of the rings as the light source, so values always range between 0 and 90 in units of degrees. For ring occultations, this value is always equal to 90 - | observed_ring_elevation | This will enable users to perform database searches based on the effective ring opening angle when they are not concerned about the distinction between northside and southside viewpoints. We have included the 'light source' prefix to the term so that this quantity is not confused with 'incidence angle', a term that is generally associated with sunlight rather than stars or radio transmitters. Required in the label if the value is constant for the observation. If the angle varies for the observation, the min and max attributes are required in the label. Optional as a field in the data table.

   description            The phase_angle element provides a measure of the relationship between the instrument viewing position and incident illumination (such as solar light). Phase angle is measured at the target; it is the angle between a vector to the illumination source and a vector to the instrument. If not specfied, the target is assumed to be at the center of the instrument field of view. If illumination is from behind the instrument, phase_angle will be small.

   description            This class is meant to collect attributes that are intended for use as column headers within data products. These attributes have been defined in this dictionary in order to promote clarity and uniformity, and in turn this class is defined in order to give these attributes a logical home. Because it is not intended for this class to ever be used in a label, its maximum occurrences is set to zero.
