   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The emission_angle element provides a measure of the relationship between the instrument viewing position and the surface normal vector at the intercept point. Specifically, it is the angle, measured at the intercept point, between the local surface normal vector and a vector in the direction of the outgoing photon to the observing instrument. The emission_angle varies from 0 degrees when the spacecraft is viewing the subspacecraft point (nadir viewing) to 90 degrees when the intercept is tangent to the surface of the target body. Thus, higher values of emission_angle indicate more oblique viewing of the target. In the context of planetary rings, the local surface normal vector is always on the side of the ring plane illuminated by the light source. Thus, the emission_angle varies from 0 degrees when the spacecraft is viewing the illuminated side of the rings face-on, to 90 degrees when viewing the rings edge-on (that is, the spacecraft is in the ring plane), to 180 degrees when the spacecraft is viewing the unlit side of the rings face-on.

   name                   geometry_reference_time_utc
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Date_Time_YMD_UTC
   description            For some observations, geometric parameters are given as instantaneous values at a specific time. Another set of instantaneous parameters are the parameters which give the minimum and maximum values in the product. In some cases, these range values are all calculated for the same time. If the label includes single valued geometric parameters or min/max range parameters determined for a specific time, geometry_reference_time_utc gives the time for which these values were calculated and must be given in the label. For some instruments, particularly those with relatively large exposure durations, (e.g., push broom cameras, many imaging spectrometers), many geometric quantities are given as ranges. If those range parameters are associated with the beginning and end of the observation (start_parameter/stop_parameter), geometry_start_time_utc/stop_time must be given. Comments within the label should be used to ensure the parameter vs. time association is unambiguous. 

   name                   geometry_start_time_utc
   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Date_Time_YMD_UTC
   description            The pair of geometry_start_time_utc/geometry_stop_time_utc may be given in the label for any observation. The pair is generally used for fairly long duration observations (a substantial portion of an hour to several hours). geometry_start_time_utc gives the time at the beginning of the observation. When either geometry_start_time_utc or geometry_stop_time_utc is given, both must be provided. Within the Geometry discipline, there are two options for providing geometric parameters as a range of values. A parameter may be given as a pair where the parameter values are those at the beginning and end of the observation (start_parameter, stop_parameter). If a (start_parameter, stop_parameter) pair is used for any geometric parameter, the pair (geometry_start_time_utc/geometry_stop_time_utc) must be given. Another option to provide geometric parameters as a pair is (minimum_parameter, maximum_parameter) defining a range of values where the values are the minimum and maximum values of that parameter for the entire observation. Comments within the label should be used to ensure the parameter vs. time association is unambiguous.

   description            Specifies the state or configuration of this instance of Geometry_Lander applies. Use of this attribute enables multiple instances of Geometry_Lander, describing the geometry under different conditions. Note that it is legal for more than one instance to have the same geometry_state, in which case the local_identifier should be used to differentiate the instances, along with description. If not present, the semantics of "Telemetry" should be assumed. It is not required that instances be retained; a derived product may have an Adjusted instance but remove the Telemetry one, for example.

   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The incidence_angle element provides a measure of the lighting condition at the intercept point. Specifically, it is the angle, measured at the intercept point, between a vector in the direction of an incoming photon from the illumination source and the local surface normal vector. The incidence_angle varies from 0 degrees when the intercept point coincides with the subsolar point to 90 degrees when the intercept is tangent to the surface of the target body. In the context of planetary rings, the local surface normal vector is always on the side of the ring plane illuminated by the light source. Thus, the incidence_angle varies from 0 degrees if the light source illuminates the rings face-on, to 90 degrees if the light source illuminates the rings edge-on.

   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The instrument_azimuth attribute specifies the value for an instrument's rotation in the horizontal direction. It may be measured from a low hard stop, or relative to a coordinate frame. Although it may be used for any instrument where it makes sense, it is primarily intended for use in surface-based instruments that measure pointing in terms of azimuth and elevation. If this value is expressed using a coordinate system, the coordinate system is specified by the Coordinate_Space_Reference class. The interpretation of exactly what part of the instrument is being pointed is mission-specific. It could be the boresight, the camera head direction, the CAHV camera model A vector direction, or any of a number of other things. As such, for multimission use this value should be used mostly as an approximation, e.g. identifying scenes which might contain a given object.

   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The solution_id attribute specifies the unique identifier for the solution set to which the values in the group belong. For certain kinds of information, such as pointing correction (pointing models) and rover localization (coordinate system definitions), the "true" value is unknown and only estimates of the true value exist. Thus, more than one set of estimates may exist simultaneously, each valid for its intended purpose. Each of these sets is called a "solution" to the unknown true value. The solution_id attribute is used to identify which solution is being expressed by the containing group. No specific naming convention is defined here, however it is recommended that projects adopt one. The intent is to be able to identify who created the solution, and why. Possible components of the naming convention include user, institution, purpose, request ID, version, program, date/time.

   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            observed_event_time indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. As a field in an occultation profile table, it is given in numeric seconds as an offset from the specified UTC reference time. The reference time is preferably the start of a day. In a label the corresponding time interval end point values are given by the required start_date_time_utc and stop_date_time_utc attributes in the Time_Coordinates class. At least one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time. Note: For occultation data, PDS prefers year-month-day format for dates rather than year plus day-of-year format. However, either format is permitted.

   description            observed_event_tdb indicates the instant at which photons were received at the instrument. It is represented in the 'Barycentric Dynamical Time' system, as a number of elapsed seconds since the J2000 epoch. This is consistent with the definition of 'ephemeris time' as used in the SPICE toolkit. In a label the corresponding values are given by the optional start_observed_event_tdb and stop_observed_event_tdb attributes. At least one of either observed_event_time or observed_event_tdb, must be a table field for occultation data. Both may be used. observed_event_time is equivalent to spacecraft_event_time for spacecraft data and to earth_received_time for Earth-based data. It is always the photon arrival time, so in this regard we treat typical spacecraft radio occultation data as Earth-based, referring to the time at the DSN receiving station. For an uplink radio occultation, this is the spacecraft event time.

   description            observed_ring_elevation is an angle measured at a point in the ring plane, starting from the ring plane to the direction of a photon heading to the observer. This angle is positive on the side of the ring plane defined by positive angular momentum, and negative on the opposite side. Values range from -90 to +90 in units of degrees. This angle is constant for stellar occultations, but may vary significantly during radio occultations. Note: The direction of positive angular momentum points toward the IAU-defined north side of the ring plane for Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, but IAU-defined south side of the ring plane for Uranus. Required in the label if the value is constant for the observation. If the angle varies for the observation, the min and max attributes are required in the label, and observed_ring_elevation is strongly recommended as a field in the data table.

Specifically, it is the angle, measured at the intercept point, between the local surface normal vector and a vector in the direction of the outgoing photon to the observing instrument. In the context of planetary rings, the local surface normal vector is always on the side of the ring plane illuminated by the light source. Thus, the emission_angle varies from 0 degrees when the spacecraft is viewing the illuminated side of the rings face-on, to 90 degrees when viewing the rings edge-on (that is, the spacecraft is in the ring plane), to 180 degrees when the spacecraft is viewing the unlit side of the rings face-on.

   description            light_source_incidence_angle is an angle measured from the local surface normal vector to the direction of a photon arriving from the light source.

For ring occultations, this value is always equal to 90 - | observed_ring_elevation | This will enable users to perform database searches based on the effective ring opening angle when they are not concerned about the distinction between northside and southside viewpoints.

   version                1.23
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            sub_stellar_clock_angle is an angle measured at a point in the ring plane, from the direction toward a star to the local radial direction. This angle is projected into the ring plane and measured in the clockwise (retrograde) direction. Equivalently, this is the prograde angle from the local radial direction to the direction toward the star. For stellar occultation data, this angle is equal to (180 - OBSERVED_RING_AZIMUTH) mod 360. It is available only for backward compatibility with previously published Cassini VIMS occultation data analysis; observed_ring_azimuth is the preferred quantity for archiving. sub_stellar_clock_angle is an optional data table field for Cassini VIMS occultation data; not recommended for other occultation data. In a label, the min and max variation attributes are optional for Cassini VIMS occultation data; not recommended for other occultation data.

   description            The basis epoch for the corotating frame. Format is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ and may be truncated. The corotating frame is defined so that zero corotating longitude is equal to zero inertial longitude defined at the epoch specified by epoch_reprojection_basis_utc. Thus, zero corotating longitude in the corotating frame at time t corresponds to an inertial longitude of (t-epoch)*corotation_rate.

   name                   CAHV_Model
   description            The CAHV model is a linear, perspective-projection camera model (equivalent to a pinhole camera). It consists of four 3-vectors (C,A,H,V) that describe the internal and external camera model parameters needed to translate between 2D image coordinates and 3D world coordinates. C (Vector_Center) is the 3D position of the pinhole (center of the entrance pupil). A (Vector_Axis) is a unit vector normal to the image plane pointing outward. H (Vector_Horizontal) is a composite vector encoding three quantities: H' (a vector in the image plane perpendicular to the vertical columns), Hs (the distance between the lens center and image plane, measured in horizontal pixels), and Hc (the horizontal image coordinate directly under C when moving parallel to A). V (Vector_Vertical) similarly composites the analogous V', Vs, and Vc in the vertical direction.

   description            The Coordinate_System_Identification class fully describes a coordinate system. This class is typically used for orbiter/flyby geometry while the Coordinate_Space construction is used for lander/rover geometry. Coordinate_System_Identification provides the reference frame, coordinate system type (cartesian, planetocentric, etc.), origin, and the instantiation time of the system when appropriate. The instantiation time (coordinate_system_time_utc) is used when a rotating frame has been 'frozen' at a particular epoch. Instantiation time is not needed for inertial or rotating frames.

   description            The Coordinate_System_Origin_Identification class uniquely identifies the "body" that is the origin of a coordinate system. Typically body centered coordinate systems place the origin at the center of mass of the body. In addition to physical bodies, the origin may be defined at a point in space such as a system barycenter. Note that the origin of coordinate system does not necessarily correspond to either end point of a vector.

In the unusual case where an image object does not have an associated disp:Display_Direction class, then, and only then, Display_Direction class defined here should be present. The Display_Direction class specifies which two of the dimensions of an Array object should be displayed and how they should be displayed in the vertical (line) and horizontal (sample) dimensions of a display device. This class is essentially the same as the class of the same name in the Display Dictionary, and is redefined here for convenience.

   description            The Geometry_Orbiter class is a container for geometric information (positions, velocities, orientations, etc.) relevant to orbiter or flyby spacecraft observations. If any of the contained classes or attributes have central body, and or target in the class or attribute name (e.g., spacecraft_to_central_body_distance, Vector_Planetocentric_Position_Spacecraft_To_Target), then the central body and or target must be identified in this class. If more than one geometry_reference_time_utc, target or central body need to be identified to fully describe the data, use multiple instances of the Geometry_Orbiter class. Do not use Coordinate_System at this level if more than one coordinate system is used in the contained classes. If more than one coordinate system is used, specify Coordinate_System in each of the subordinate classes where it is appropriate.

   description            The Illumination_Min_Max class contains attributes providing illumination parameters as minimum/maximum pairs. For any given illumination parameter if one of minimum or maximum is given, both must be given. If a target is specified using the Geometry_Target_Identification class in the Orbiter_Identification class under the same parent Geometry_Orbiter class, the min-max pairs for each illumination parameter provide the range of that parameter in the observation on that target. Otherwise the pair provides the range for the entire field of view.

   name                   Image_Display_Geometry
   description            Image_Display_Geometry class provides an unambiguous description of the orientation of the image contents. This class assumes an image is displayed as described by a disp:Display_Direction class elsewhere in the label. In the unusual case where an image object does not have an associated disp:Display_Direction class, then, and only then, the optionalgeom:Display_Direction class in this class should be present. Coupled with the information in the associated Display_Direction class, any one of the Object_Orientation_* classes should allow unambiguous orientation of the contents of the image. The Local_Internal_Reference class is used to identify the object to which this instance of the Image_Display_Geometry class applies, and must be used if there is more than one instance of Image_Display_Geometry in the label. The appropriate value for local_reference_type is image_display_to_object. The Object_Orientation_North_East class is typically used for instruments for which the entire field of view is a portion of the target surface (e.g., instruments on Mars orbital spacecraft); otherwise use Object_Orientation_RA_Dec (e.g., flyby missions, missions with orbit radii much larger than the target radius such as Voyager or Cassini). At least one of these must be used. The two *_Identification classes used here are Central_Body (e.g., Saturn if you are using Planetocentric or planetographic coordinates in the Saturn system) and Target when the described object in the FoV is not the Central_Body. For example giving the orientation of the pole of Enceladus in Saturn Planetocentric coordinates, Central_Body = Saturn, Target = Enceladus. Bottom line: put in enough information so someone else can figure out the orientation of the field of view. We also offer an option to provide the pointing information as a quaternion.

   name                   Motion_Counter
   description            The Motion_Counter class provides a set of integers that describe a (potentially) unique location (position / orientation) for a rover or other movable object. Each time an event occurs that results in a movement, a new motion counter value is created. This includes intentional motion due to drive commands, as well as potential motion due to other articulating devices, such as arms or antennae. This motion counter (or part of it) is used as a reference to define instances of coordinate systems that can move such as SITE or ROVER frames. The motion counter is defined in a mission-specific manner. Although the original intent was to have incrementing indices (e.g., MER), the motion counter could also contain any integer values that conform to the above definition, such as time or spacecraft clock values.

   name                   PSPH_Model
   description             A new camera model designed to perform better fisheye-image rectification prior to 1D stereo correlation. The primary innovation is the use of a unit projection sphere rather than an image plane. For epipolar alignment between stereo cameras the rows (for a left/right pair) or the columns (for an up/down pair) of both must lie along the same plane. Thus we use a pair of planes to define the rows and columns. Each plane will rotate around a static dedicated axis passing through the sphere center. Pixels will be located where the planes intersect with each other and the unit sphere.

   name                   Quaternion_Base
   description            The Quaternion_Base class defines a quaternion that represents rotation between two right-handed reference frames. In this dictionary, quaternions are always constructed so that the application of the quaternion describes the rotation of one frame to a second frame. The two frames and the direction of rotation must be identified unambiguously in the enclosing classes. Quaternions are expressed as a set of four numbers in the order (qcos, qsin1, qsin2, qsin3), where qcos = cos(theta/2) and qsin(n) = sin(theta/2)*a(n). Theta is the angle of rotation and a is the unit vector (x,y,z) around which the rotation occurs. A document providing the full mathematical basis for this construction, along with examples, and a summary of common pitfalls, is in preparation. The current version can be obtained by contacting the PDS Engineering Node. In application you need to know the four elements of the quaternion, the two end point frames, and the direction of the rotation. This dictionary provides two extensions to this Base class. In the Quaternion_Plus_Direction class we require the direction of rotation. This class can only be used if the two end point frames are identified in the enclosing class. This is generally the case in the Lander section. The Quaternion_Plus_To_From class requires the two frames be identified explicitly with one designated as the "from frame" and the other as the "to frame".

   name                   Quaternion_Model_Transform
   description            The Quaternion_Model_Transform class specifies, along with Vector_Model_Transform class, the transform used for the camera model in an image. Camera models created by the calibration process have associated with them a pose, comprised of the position (offset) and orientation (quaternion) of the camera at the time it was calibrated. The model is transformed ("pointed") for a specific image by computing, generally using articulation device kinematics, a final pose for the image. The camera model is then translated and rotated from the calibration to final pose. This class specifies the quaternion portion of the final pose.

   description            The Vector_Model_Transform class specifies, along with the Quaternion_Model_Transform class, the transform used for the camera model in this image. Camera models created by the calibration process have associated with them a pose, comprised of the position (offset) and orientation (quaternion) of the camera at the time it was calibrated. The model is transformed ("pointed") for a specific image by computing, generally using articulation device kinematics, a final pose for the image. The camera model is then translated and rotated from the calibration to final pose. This class specifies the offset portion of the final pose.

   description            This class is meant to collect attributes that are intended for use as column headers within data products. These attributes have been defined in this dictionary in order to promote clarity and uniformity, and in turn this class is defined in order to give these attributes a logical home. Because it is not intended for this class to ever be used in a label, its maximum occurrences is set to zero.
